## Introduction

### WHAT DO THEY DO?
Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Thing about an array, an array holds many values and also contains the relationships between those values (the order), and comes with built-in methods and functionality.

There are many because some of them are very specialized, but some of them are pretty general.
